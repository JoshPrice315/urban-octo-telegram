# Code Refactor 
The goal of this project is to fix broken parts of the website (i.e broken links) and optimize the site by organizing code and doing things such as removing duplicate code. The orginal code had multiple class links in the CSS that had the same exact declerations which is unnecessary and can be given a single class instead. We must also deploy the site on github and include screenshots in the readme of the site. I did so below with relative pathing to a folder in the project files.
